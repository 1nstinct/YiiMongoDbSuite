# Model generation {#model}

- you do not have to generate yours models, yours classes are yours models and schemas!
- Gii CAN'T generate models for you! there is no schema witch gii can exam for generation

# CRUD Generation {#crud}

Now you can generate CRUD for yours MongoDB Documents! just you have to add generator path to yours Gii config

> [Important]
> By default generated models will use mongo `_id` field as a primary key (using MongoId class)
> this generator will use different field as a primary key, if you will override `primaryKey()` method to return
> something different than '_id'. Note that generator cannot handle with multifield primary key,

~~~
[php]
// in yours main.php config file:
'modules'=>array(
	// ...

	'gii'=>array(
		'class'=>'system.gii.GiiModule',
		'password'=>'yours_password_to_gii',
		// add additional generator path
		'generatorPaths'=>array(
			'ext.YiiMongoDbSuite.gii'
		),
	),

	// ...
),
// Now login to Gii and start using Mongocrud generator !
~~~


# Forms generation {#forms}

- This is a good news, Gii can generate the worst part of developer job, forms for mongo records ;]
- When generating a form from mongo record, comment out embedded docs array, or you'll see error about array/object creation
- For embedded docs just generate forms in separed way for each one
