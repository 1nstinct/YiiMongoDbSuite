Title: Write Queries Flags
Author: Dariusz GÃ³recki <darek.krk@gmail.com>

We now can set value for write queries flags FSync and/or Safe on a different scopes:

- Global scope, by setting it in EMongoDB component class itself (required)
- Model scope, bu using ModelClass::model()->setFsyncFlag($flagValue) or ModelClass::model()->setSafeFlag($flagValue)
- Single Model object by using $singleModelObject->sefFsyncFlag($flag) or $singleModelObject->sefSafeFlag($flag)

State of write queries flags is connected

- Setting FSync to false, will set Safe flag to false automatically
- Setting Safe flag to true, will set FSync flag to true automatically 

Now, we may whant all DB operations to be synced to disk, and we set global FSync flag in MongoDB component config,
but we feagure uot that, for ie. massive temporary models like DB logging objects are not important, and for performance
reasons, we whant to disable FSync for this models only. 

We may do so: LogModelClass::model()->setFsyncFlag(false);

From now on, all LogModelClass objects will be written to DB without waitng to filesystem sync.

For user comfort, FSync and Safe flags may be set just for single model instance by, $singleModelInstance->setFsyncFlag(false),
this will not affect any other model instance.
