Title: Setup
Author: Dariusz GÃ³recki <darek.krk@gmail.com>

---

In your main configuration file, witch is by default: `protected/config/main.php` config file.

Add the following to the file:

~~~
[php]
'import' => array(
	// ...
	'ext.YiiMongoDbSuite.*',
),

'components' => array(
	// ...
	'mongodb' => array(
		'class'				=> 'EMongoDB',
		'connectionString'	=> 'mongodb://localhost',
		'dbName'			=> 'myDatabaseName',
		'fsyncFlag'			=> true,
		'safe'				=> true,
		'useCursor'			=> false,
	),
	// ...
),
~~~

- connectionString: 'localhost' should be changed to the ip or hostname of your host being connected to. For example if connecting
  to a server it might be `'connectionString' => 'mongodb://username@xxx.xx.xx.xx'` where xx.xx.xx.xx is the ip (or hostname)
  of your webserver or host.
- dbName: is the name you want the collections to be stored in. The database name.
- fsyncFlag is set to true, this makes mongodb make sure all writes to the database are safely stored to disk.
  Setting this to false will improve speed but writes are not confirmed. So unless you are doing massive or large
  imports or save() then it is better to be set to true. See the [performance section][special#performance].
- safeFlag // TODO
- useCursor flag // TODO
- For more info see the [MongoDB connection page on php.net](http://php.net/manual/en/mongo.connecting.php).

That's all you have to do for setup. You can use it very much like the active record.
Short example:

~~~
[php]
$client = new Client;
$client->first_name='something';
$client->save();
$clients = Client::model->findAll();
