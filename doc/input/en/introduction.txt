This extension is an almost complete, ActiveRecord like support for MongoDB in Yii

It originally started as a fork of [MongoRecord](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/mongorecord "MongoRecord")
extension written by [tyohan](http://www.yiiframework.com/user/31/ "tyohan"),
to fix some major bugs, and add full featured suite for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org "MongoDB") developers.

**IMPORTANT!: Versions below 1.1 are deprecated, they have some major bugs**

## Limitations:

- The main limitations are only those present in MongoDB itself, like the 4MB single document data limit. But That's not a big deal either.
- In it's current incarnation, This extension does NOT work with the OR operator. When we get it working we will remove this line and add an example.

## Requirements:

- Yii 1.1.5 is required, yii 1.1.4 do not have onAfterConstruct event whitch is used here
- MongoDB latest stable is recommended. Untested with older versions.
